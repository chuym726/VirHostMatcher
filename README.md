VirHostMatcher: matching hosts of viruses based on oligonucleotide frequency (ONF) comparison
===========

Basic tools for computing various oligonucleotide frequency (ONF) based distance/dissimialrity measures


Requirements
---------------

The source code is written by python and C++. Thus it requires python and C++ compiler. It works under Windows, Linux or Mac environment. 


Usage
---------------

This program is used to compute various oligonucleotide frequency (ONF) based distance/dissimialrity measures between a pair of DNA sequences. Computing these measures with VirHostMatcher is specifically used to predict the potential host of a query virus by identifying the host to which it has the strongest similarity. Predictions are based on the observation that viruses and hosts often share similar ONF patterns (Ahlgren, Ren et al. submitted). The measures computed by VirHostMatcher include Euclidian distance (Eu), Manhattan distance (Ma), Chebyshev distance (Ch), Jensen-Shannon divergence (JS), d2 dissimilarity, d2\* dissimilarity, d2S dissimilarity, Hao dissimilarity, Teeling dissimilarity, EuF distance and Willner distance. There is also the option to only compute d2* dissimilarity. See paper "Alignment-free d2\* oligonucleotide frequency dissimilarity measure improves accuracy of predicting virus-host interactions" (Ahlgren, Ren et al. submitted) for the definitions. The tool also provides user-friendly visualization of virus-host interactions based on the pairwise distance/dissimilarity between viruses and hosts. 

To use the tool, please simply follow the steps and copy and paste the following commands to the terminal command line. Please do not forget to adjust the path variables to your own (i.e. replace "<Path_to_XXX>" with your own path). 

You can find an folder named "test" containing 2 virus sequences and 3 host sequences in fasta format. Here we use this test data to show how to use the tool.

* Step 1: download the whole package from https://github.com/jessieren/VirHostMatcher

* Step 2: Prepare a folder containing virus fasta files and a folder containing host fasta files. No subfolders are allowed. All fasta files should be put in the same directory.

* Step 3: Prepare a text file for taxonomy of the hosts. Please follow the format in /test/hostTaxa.txt. One line for one host sequence. The sequence names should keep the same as the names of the host fasta files. 
	If there is no taxonomy information, a hostTaxa.txt file will be generated in the output directory with all "unknown"s.

* Step 4: Run the program use the following command. 

		python /Path_to_VirHostMatcher/vhm.py -v <Path_to_virus_folder(required)> -b <Path_to_host_folder(required)> -o <Path_to_output(required)> -t <Path_to_hostTaxaFile> -d <1_if_only_compute_d2star>

	For detailed description of the paramter settings,
		python /Path_to_VirHostMatcher/vhm.py --help 

* Congratulations! The results can be find in <Path_to_output>. The output folder contains,

	[measure Name]_k[k-tuple length].csv	The dissimilarity/distance matrix for paris of virus and hosts;

	[measure Name]_k[k-tuple length].main.html	The html file for visulization of the virus-host interactions;

If you found a bug or mistake in this project, we would like to know about it.
Before you send us the bug report though, please check the following:

1. Are you using the latest version? The bug you found may already have been
fixed.
2. Check that your input is in the correct format and you have selected the
correct options.
3. Please reduce your input to the smallest possible size that still produces
the bug; we will need your input data to reproduce the problem, and the
smaller you can make it, the easier it will be.
