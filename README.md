Sequence comparison oligonucleotide frequency (ONF)
===========

basic tools for computing various oligonucleotide frequency (ONF) based distance/dissimialrity measures


Requirements
---------------

AlignFreeTools is intended to be used in a Unix-based environment. It has been tested
on Mac OS and Linux.


Usage
---------------

Description
This program is used to compute various oligonucleotide frequency (ONF) based distance/dissimialrity measures between a pair of DNA sequences. These measures include Euclidian distance (Eu), Manhattan distance (Ma), Chebyshev distance (Ch), Jensen-Shannon divergence (JS), d2, d2*, d2S, Hao, Teeling, EuF and Willner. See paper "Alignment-free d2* oligonucleotide frequency dissimilarity measure improves accuracy of predicting virus-host interactions" for the definitions. The source code is written by C++, and it should be compiled and executed under Windows, Linux or Mac environment.


#### parameter setting ####
> k=6
> order=2

#### path setting ####
## directory to the c++ code ##
> codeDIR=/Users/jessie/Desktop/alignment-free/script/
## directories to the phage and host fasta files ##
> phageFaDIR=/Users/jessie/Desktop/alignment-free/script/test/phage
> hostFaDIR=/Users/jessie/Desktop/alignment-free/script/test/host
## directory to the output ##
> outDIR=/Users/jessie/Desktop/alignment-free/script/test/output
> mkdir $outDIR

#### compile the code ####
> g++ $codeDIR/countKmer.cpp -o $codeDIR/countKmer.out
> g++ $codeDIR/computeMeasure.cpp -o $codeDIR/computeMeasure.out

#### copy the following to the command line ####
## generate the file containing the phage and host file paths ##
> > $outDIR/hostList
> > $outDIR/phageList

## count the 1-6-mers for phage and host fasta sequences ##
> for fa in $phageFaDIR/*
do
name=`basename $fa`
kmerDIR=$outDIR/kmerCount/$name
for klength in $(seq 1 $k)
do
$codeDIR/countKmer.out -l -k $klength -i $fa -o $kmerDIR
done
echo $name $kmerDIR $order >> $outDIR/phageList
done

>for fa in $hostFaDIR/*
do
name=`basename $fa`
kmerDIR=$outDIR/kmerCount/$name
for klength in $(seq 1 $k)
do
$codeDIR/countKmer.out -l -k $klength -i $fa -o $kmerDIR
done
echo $name $kmerDIR $order >> $outDIR/hostList
done

## compute distance/dissimialrity using various measures ##
> $codeDIR/computeMeasure.out -k $k -i $outDIR/phageList -j $outDIR/hostList > $outDIR/results.csv

#### the results can be find in $outDIR/results.csv done! ####

If you found a bug or mistake in this project, we would like to know about it.
Before you send us the bug report though, please check the following:

1. Are you using the latest version? The bug you found may already have been
fixed.
2. Check that your input is in the correct format and you have selected the
correct options.
3. Please reduce your input to the smallest possible size that still produces
the bug; we will need your input data to reproduce the problem, and the
smaller you can make it, the easier it will be.
